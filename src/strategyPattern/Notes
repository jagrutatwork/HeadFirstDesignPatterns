### Strategy Pattern Summary Notes

- **Definition:**  
  - **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

- **Key Principles:**
  - **Encapsulation:** Each behavior (or algorithm) is encapsulated in its own class.
  - **Interchangeability:** Different behaviors can be swapped easily at runtime.
  - **Composition over Inheritance:** Instead of hardcoding behavior with inheritance, the Context class holds a reference to a Strategy, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.
  - **Open/Closed Principle:** The system is open for extension (by adding new strategies) but closed for modification (existing code doesnâ€™t change).

- **Structure:**
  - **Context:** The class that uses a Strategy. It delegates the behavior to the Strategy interface.
  - **Strategy Interface:** Declares common methods (e.g., `fly()`, `quack()` in the duck example).
  - **Concrete Strategies:** Specific implementations of the Strategy interface (e.g., `FlyWithWings`, `NoFly`, `Quack`, `MuteQuack`).

- **Usage:**
  - Ideal when you need different variants of an algorithm.
  - Useful for scenarios requiring runtime selection of behavior.
  - Avoids cluttering code with conditional statements (if/else or switch statements) to choose algorithms.

- **Example in a Duck Context:**
  ```java
  public abstract class Duck {
      FlyBehavior flyBehavior;
      QuackBehavior quackBehavior;
  
      public abstract void display();
  
      public void performFly() {
          flyBehavior.fly();
      }
  
      public void performQuack() {
          quackBehavior.quack();
      }
  
      public void setFlyBehavior(FlyBehavior fb) {
          flyBehavior = fb;
      }
  
      public void setQuackBehavior(QuackBehavior qb) {
          quackBehavior = qb;
      }
  }
  
  public class MallardDuck extends Duck {
      public MallardDuck() {
          quackBehavior = new Quack();
          flyBehavior = new FlyWithWings();
      }
  
      public void display() {
          System.out.println("I'm a real Mallard duck");
      }
  }
  ```

- **Benefits:**
  - **Flexibility:** Easily change algorithms at runtime.
  - **Maintainability:** Adding new behaviors doesn't alter existing code.
  - **Reusability:** Strategies can be reused across different contexts.

- **Potential Drawbacks:**
  - **Class Explosion:** Can result in many small strategy classes.
  - **Overhead:** Slightly increases complexity if overused for trivial behaviors.
